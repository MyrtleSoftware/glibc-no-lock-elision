Subject: [PATCH] CVE-2015-1781: resolv/nss_dns/dns-host.c buffer overflow [BZ#18287]

	[BZ #18287]
	* resolv/nss_dns/dns-host.c (getanswer_r): Adjust buffer length
	based on padding.  (CVE-2015-1781)

* A buffer overflow in gethostbyname_r and related functions performing DNS
  requests has been fixed.  If the NSS functions were called with a
  misaligned buffer, the buffer length change due to pointer alignment was
  not taken into account.  This could result in application crashes or,
  potentially arbitrary code execution, using crafted, but syntactically
  valid DNS responses.  (CVE-2015-1781)

[Note: patch differs from upstream commit in that the entries in
the Changelog and NEWS were dropped to avoid patch conflicts. -- sbeattie]
