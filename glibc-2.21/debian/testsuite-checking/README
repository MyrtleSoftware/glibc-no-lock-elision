Testsuite Regression Testing
============================

This directory contains a file for each arch/os, listing the allowed failures
during a testsuite run for a given arch/os pair. The files are listed as
"${arch-os}-test-results".  Where "${arch-os}" is extracted by rules as 
"$(call xx,configure_target)".

A script, "convertlog.sh", can be used to process the normal log-test-*
file into a test-results-* file.

Since we cannot run the testsuite without "-k", we run the enitre testsuite
ignoring errors. Then we compare the error set with the expected errors, 
differences in signal numbers or errors fails the build. If the architecture
does not have a test-results-* file a warning is given and no comparison is
made.
